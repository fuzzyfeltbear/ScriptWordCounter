# Script Word Counter

A simple utility intended for the GWA and similar audio script communities to make up for a feature lacking in Scrivener and other writing tools. It counts words, ignoring any cues and directions in parenthesis () or square brackets []. Contractions (can't, won't) and hyphenated words (book-bag) are counted as one word.
